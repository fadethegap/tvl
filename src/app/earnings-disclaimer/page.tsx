                There is no guarantee that you will earn any money using the
                techniques and ideas in these materials. Examples in these
                materials are not to be interpreted as a promise or guarantee of
                earnings. Earning potential is entirely dependent on the person

                this product as a “get rich scheme.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Any claims made of actual earnings or examples of actual results
                can be verified upon request. Your level of success in attaining
                the results claimed in our materials depends on the time you
                devote to the program, ideas and techniques mentioned, your
                finances, knowledge and various skills. Since these factors
                differ according to individuals, we cannot guarantee your
                success or income level. Nor are we responsible for any of your
                actions.

                Materials in our product and on our website may contain
                information that includes or is based upon forward-looking
                statements within the meaning of the securities litigation
                reform act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our
                expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify
                these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
                historical or current facts. They use words such as
                “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,”
                “believe,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in
                connection with a description of potential earnings or financial
                performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any and all forward looking statements here or on any of our
                sales material are intended to express our opinion of earnings
                potential. Many factors will be important in determining your
                actual results and no guarantees are made that you will achieve
                results similar to ours or anybody else’s, in fact, no
                guarantees are made that you will achieve any results from our
                ideas and techniques in our material.

                earnings, or that you will earn any money, with respect to your
                purchase of Paul Xavier’s products, and that we have not

                Any earnings or income statements, or any earnings or income
                examples, are only estimates of what we think you could earn.
                There is no assurance you will do as well as stated in any
                examples. If you rely upon any figures provided, you must accept
                the entire risk of not doing as well as the information
                provided. This applies whether the earnings or income examples
                are monetary in nature or pertain to advertising credits which
                may be earned (whether such credits are convertible to cash or
                not).
              </p>
              <p>
                There is no assurance that any prior successes or past results
                as to earnings or income (whether monetary or advertising
                credits, whether convertible to cash or not) will apply, nor can
                any prior successes be used, as an indication of your future
                success or results from any of the information, content, or
                strategies. Any and all claims or representations as to income
                or earnings (whether monetary or advertising credits, whether
                convertible to cash or not) are not to be considered as “average

                (i) The Economy. The economy, both where you do business, and on
                a national and even worldwide scale, creates additional
                uncertainty and economic risk. An economic recession or
                depression might negatively affect the results produced by Paul
                Xavier’s products.
              </p>
              <p>
                (ii) Your Success Or Lack Of It. Your success in using the
                information or strategies provided at https://mrpaulxavier.com
                depends on a variety of factors. We have no way of knowing how
                well you will do, as we do not know you, your background, your
                work ethic, your dedication, your motivation, your desire, or
                your business skills or practices. Therefore, we do not
                guarantee or imply that you will get rich, that you will do as
                well, or that you will have any earnings (whether monetary or
                advertising credits, whether convertible to cash or not), at
                all.

                up, operating, and/or marketing Paul Xavier’s products, and
                further, that you may have no earnings at all (whether monetary
